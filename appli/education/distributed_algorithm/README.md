Distributed algorithms
======================

Practical work for course 'Distributed Algorithms and Network Systems' from
MiSCIT Master - Grenoble - Fall 2014.

Prepared by Federican Garin and GaÃ«tan Harter

Goal
----

Cooperative algorithms using radio communicating nodes:

* Estimate the average of all node a randomly generated value
    * Syncronous communication
    * 'Gossip' mode communication
* Estimate the whole number of nodes
